Template for SearchBar Block
============================

```
{
    "block_type": "search-bar-001",
    "data": {
        "type": "simple",
        "placeholder": "Search products..."
    }
}
```
The variable `type` represents the type of the search bar. Currently we only have `"simple"` type, but there could be more types in the future. The variable `placeholder` represents the text inside the search bar.
